Physics Masters graduate with a solid optical background. Familiar with light-based imaging techniques and nanophotonic principles. Designed, built and maintained optical setups during internships at AMOLF and ARCNL. Experienced with Python-based programming to analyze and present experimental data. I am eager to join Astrape Networkâ€™s brilliant team to utilize optical technologies to deliver low latency solutions for data centers.
